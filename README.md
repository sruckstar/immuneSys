This script adds a full scale immunity system for Michael, Franklin and Trevor. Immunity affects special abilities of each of the characters: for example, having 100% immunity you will be able to use your special ability indefinitely. Should you not watch out for character's health and let immunity drop lower than 10%, special abilities will be unavailable. When immunity reaches zero, your character will start falling occasionally.

Runï»¿ning, jumping, swimming in the water during sunny weather will raise the immunity. Having soaking wet clothes under the rain, staying in the vehicle for prolonged periods of time, hospital visits will lower your immunity. To know current immunity status, press I button (key bind can be changed in INI file).
